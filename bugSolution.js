The solution typically involves carefully reviewing the Android build configuration.  Steps may include:

1. **Check your `android/app/build.gradle` file**: Ensure all dependencies, particularly those for `react-native-reanimated`, are correctly declared and included.
2. **Clean and rebuild**: Use `expo prebuild` followed by `expo run:android` to clear the build cache and force a clean rebuild.
3. **Check your `android/settings.gradle`**:  Make sure the native modules are properly included.
4. **Update dependencies**: Update `react-native-reanimated` and its related packages to their latest versions. 
5. **Verify the Android environment**:  Ensure your Android SDK, NDK, and build tools are correctly installed and configured.
6. **Examine detailed error messages**: Carefully review the full error message provided during the build process to identify the root cause. Often, specific instructions on how to resolve the issue will be included within the error itself.
